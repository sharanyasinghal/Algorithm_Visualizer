# Algorithm Visualizer

**Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web-based tool designed to make learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) engaging and intuitive. With step-by-step visualizations, users can observe how algorithms work, manipulate inputs, and deepen their understanding through hands-on experimentation.

## Features

- **Visualize Popular Data Structures:**
  - **Arrays**: Create, insert, delete operations.
  - **Stacks & Queues**: Basic stack/queue operations (push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, peek).
  - **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, circular lists with stack/queue representations.
  - **Binary Search Trees**: Create, insert, delete, find, and traversals.
  - **Graphs**: Build graphs and visualize algorithms (BFS, DFS, Kruskal’s, Prim’s, Dijkstra’s, etc.).
  - **Heap**: Heapify, insert, delete.
  - **Hash Tables, Disjoint Sets, Tries, Segment Trees**.

- **Algorithm Animation:**
  - **Sorting**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Counting Sort.
  - **Searching**: Linear and Binary search.
  - **Recursion & Backtracking**: Fibonacci, factorial, N-Queens, maze, sudoku.
  - **Dynamic Programming**: TSP, Knapsack (0/1, unbounded), partition, rod cutting, coin change, LCS, SCS, Levenshtein distance, ladder problem.
  - **Greedy & Divide-and-Conquer**: Job scheduling, money counting, merge/quick sort, etc.
  - **Graph Algorithms**: Topological sort, cycle detection, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, coloring, TSP, bridges, strongly connected components, bipartite check.

- **Time Complexity Section:**  
  Learn about Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notations with illustrative examples.

- **String Algorithms:**  
  Includes KMP, Boyer-Moore, and more.

- **Practice Problems:**  
  Curated list of algorithmic questions by topic for self-assessment.
